# Modern Java Script For react 

## ES6 Features 
- Variables creation using "let" and "const"
- Template String 
- Arrow Functions 
- Rest and Spread Operator 
- Destructing 
- Array Functions: find() and FindIndex()
- Classes 
- Promises 
-  ... 

- Some ES6 code is not compatible with some brosers for this reason we use preprocessor like Babel to handle this problem.

- **[Babel](https://babeljs.io/)** is a preprocessor for JavaScript/ECMAScript. It is mainly used to convert ES6+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript that can be run by older browsers. 

## 1. Variable Creation using "let" and "const"
ES6 introduces 2 new ways to create variables. They do not allow hoisting. The benific of this is to reduce errors.

- **let**: It is like a replacement for var. 
    ```
    let name="Dina";
    let age=24;
    ```
- **const** It is used to create vars with constant values. The vars created using const cannot be updated later in the code.
    ```
    const API_URL = "https://google.com";
    ```
